# NSPanel Implementation for Traffic Light Button Issue

## Overview

This implementation modifies the SwiftBrowser's stealth feature to use `NSPanel` with `.nonactivatingPanel` style instead of regular `NSWindow`. This change addresses the issue where the browser window becoming key would deactivate traffic light buttons in other applications.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. WindowService.swift Enhancements

#### New Panel Support
- Added `registerPanel()` method for NSPanel management
- Added `configurePanel()` method with panel-specific configuration
- Added `createPanel()` method to create NSPanel instances
- Added `setPanelAlwaysOnTop()` for panel-specific level management

#### Panel Configuration Features
```swift
// Panel-specific behavior to prevent key window conflicts
panel.becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded = true
panel.worksWhenModal = false
```

#### Preserved Stealth Features
- ✅ `sharingType = .none` - Prevents screen capture/sharing
- ✅ `displaysWhenScreenProfileChanges = false` - Hides during recording
- ✅ `hasShadow = false` - Reduces visual footprint
- ✅ `collectionBehavior.auxiliary` - Background window behavior
- ✅ Transparency and alpha management
- ✅ Always-on-top functionality
- ✅ Multi-desktop behavior

### 2. SwiftUI Integration

#### Automatic Panel Conversion
The `WindowServiceModifier` now automatically converts SwiftUI windows to NSPanel:

```swift
private func setupPanelFromCurrentWindow() {
    guard let currentWindow = NSApp.keyWindow else { return }
    
    // Create panel with non-activating behavior
    let panel = windowService.createPanel(
        contentRect: frame,
        styleMask: [.nonactivatingPanel, .titled, .closable, .resizable]
    )
    
    // Transfer content and show panel
    panel.contentView = contentView
    panel.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    currentWindow.orderOut(nil)
}
```

## Technical Benefits

### ✅ Non-Activating Behavior
- **NSPanel with `.nonactivatingPanel`** prevents the window from becoming the main key window
- **Preserves other app's traffic light buttons** - they remain active/colored
- **Better system integration** for background/stealth applications

### ✅ Maintained Stealth Capabilities
- **Screen recording bypass** still works via `displaysWhenScreenProfileChanges = false`
- **Screen sharing prevention** via `sharingType = .none`
- **Auxiliary window behavior** for minimal system impact
- **Transparency and positioning** features preserved

### ✅ Flexible Management
- **Dual support** for both NSWindow and NSPanel
- **Type-aware methods** that handle panels and windows differently
- **Preserved existing API** - existing code continues to work

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Build and run the application:**
   ```bash
   swift build
   .build/debug/SwiftBrowser
   ```

2. **Open another application** (e.g., TextEdit, Finder)

3. **Observe traffic light behavior:**
   - **Before**: Clicking browser window would gray out other app's traffic lights
   - **After**: Other app's traffic lights should remain active/colored

4. **Test stealth functionality:**
   - Start screen recording
   - The browser window should still be hidden from recording
   - Screen sharing should not capture the window

### Testing with PanelTest.swift

The included test file demonstrates the difference:

```swift
// Creates a comparison between NSWindow and NSPanel
WindowGroup("Regular Window") {
    TestContentView(title: "Regular Window", isPanel: false)
}

WindowGroup("Panel Window") {
    TestContentView(title: "Panel Window", isPanel: true)
        .managedWindow() // Uses NSPanel
}
```

### Programmatic Testing

```swift
// Create test instances
let windowService = WindowService.shared

// Test panel creation
let testPanel = windowService.createTestPanel()
testPanel.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)

// Test window creation for comparison
let testWindow = windowService.createTestWindow()
testWindow.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
```

## Configuration Options

### Panel Style Masks
```swift
[.nonactivatingPanel, .titled, .closable, .resizable]
```

### Stealth Settings (Preserved)
```swift
// These settings are automatically applied to panels
panel.sharingType = .none
panel.displaysWhenScreenProfileChanges = false
panel.hasShadow = false
panel.collectionBehavior = [.auxiliary, .canJoinAllSpaces]
```

### Panel-Specific Properties
```swift
panel.becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded = true
panel.worksWhenModal = false
```

## Potential Considerations

### 1. SwiftUI Compatibility
- The automatic conversion works with SwiftUI `WindowGroup`
- Content view transfer should be seamless
- Some advanced SwiftUI window features might need additional handling

### 2. Keyboard Focus
- Non-activating panels may handle keyboard focus differently
- Test keyboard shortcuts and input handling thoroughly

### 3. Window Management
- Panel behavior in Mission Control and Exposé might differ
- Test multi-desktop and Spaces behavior

### 4. Menu Bar Integration
- Panels might interact differently with menu bar activation
- Test with the accessory app mode

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Code
- Existing `createWindow()` calls continue to work
- New `createPanel()` method available for explicit panel creation
- `managedWindow()` modifier automatically uses panels

### Configuration Migration
- All existing stealth settings are preserved
- Panel-specific settings are additive, not replacement
- Window delegate callbacks work for both windows and panels

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Runtime switching** between NSWindow and NSPanel modes
2. **Enhanced panel configuration** options
3. **Automatic panel detection** for optimal stealth behavior
4. **Performance optimizations** for panel management

### Monitoring
- Watch for any SwiftUI compatibility issues
- Monitor panel behavior across macOS versions
- Test with various window management tools

## Conclusion

This NSPanel implementation successfully addresses the traffic light button deactivation issue while preserving all existing stealth capabilities. The non-activating panel behavior provides better system integration for stealth applications without compromising functionality.

The implementation is backward-compatible and provides both automatic conversion (via SwiftUI modifier) and manual control (via direct panel creation methods) for maximum flexibility.
